# flask_react_base


A full-stack web application (with integrated IoT communication) that uses python-flask on the backend (as an API) and react.js with redux on the front end. This is a general application that can serve as boilerplate code, ready to be moulded into projects that serve a more specific purpose. Template/Static directory included in flask API for debugging and development purposes, but can be ignored if the developer chooses to use react for front end as I have done here. The database is a placeholder and is only an example for CRUD and comms. SocketIO example will work with raspberryPI. Other IoT devices can be configured to communiate via HTTP or MQTT.
